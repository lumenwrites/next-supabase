Auth helpers simplify using Supabase with Next SSR and routes. They:
- Auomatically set a cookie when the user logs in, and access this cookie in api routes and `getServerSideProps`, which is required for being able to use Supabase on server side with Next.js.
- `withPageAuth` wrapper around `getServerSideProps` helps you fetch the logged in user (with `getUser`) and run supabase queries on server side (with `supabaseServerClient`).
- `withApiAuth` wrapper around api handlers does the same for API routes.

AuthContext fetches additional user data I have defined in my own `profile` table.
